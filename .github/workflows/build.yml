          ## UNI2 D Folder Bypass

          **Installation:**
          1. Download `nuunibypass.zip`
          2. Extract both files to your game directory (same folder as `uni2.exe`)
          3. Launch the game normally

          **Features:**
          - Pattern-based patching (works across game updates)
          - No launcher required
          - Works with Steam
          - Auto-clears log on each launch

          See [README.md](https://github.com/Armonte/nuunibypass/blob/main/README.md) for more details.

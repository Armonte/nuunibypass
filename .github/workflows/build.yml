          ## UNI2 D Folder Bypass

          **Installation:**
          1. Download `winmm.dll` and `steam_appid.txt`
          2. Place both files in your game directory (same folder as `uni2.exe`)

          - Pattern-based patching (works across game updates)
          - No launcher required
          - Works with Steam
          - Auto-clears log on each launch
